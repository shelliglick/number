This is the number guessing project.
Number guessing is a game in which the user is supposed to guess a number between 1 and 10 in five tries.
I case the user succeeded, he wins, otherwise he may try a new game.

This repo has a separate branch for each step of this exercise:
1. clean-project - A clean empty spring boot project
2. step1 - A simple controller exposing the number guessing thru HTTP GET request with single num parameter
